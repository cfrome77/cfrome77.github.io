I don\u0026rsquo;t remember my exact age, but I must have been 7 or 8. He gave me one of the unfinished Lincoln penny books he had from his collection. I was also given a big book of the U.S. to use for collecting the state quarters (1999 - 2008). From there I have continued to grow my collection and a love for coin collecting. As a side note, while in the Boy Scouts, I did earn the coin collecting merit badge.\nMy Collections # I began my collection by collecting pennies and state quarters. Eventually I wanted to add to my collection and began to collect nickels, dimes, and Washington quarters. I have even begun to amass a small collection of foreign coins as well. Most all of my U.S. coin collecting has come from finding coins in circulation. I always ask people to see their change, which they may think is a little weird.\nPennies # Pennies have always been the main thing I have collected. I have only focused on Lincoln pennies (1909 - Present) and mainly find them through circulation. When my grandfather would come over he would always bring any quarters he found that were on my needs list. I began to get into the older Lincoln pennies (1909 - WWII) when my grandmother gave me a penny book she had with a number of pennies from the 10s - 40s. I have been able to even find some pennies from the 20s in circulation.\nNickels # I have begun to collect nickels as well, but as this is not one of my main focuses I have not been as headstrong as I have with pennies and quarters. I look through change to see what I can find, but do not go out of my way to find nickels as I do for pennies and quarters. I hope to find a way to pique my interest in nickels, just like I have in pennies and quarters.\nDimes # As with nickels this is not one of my primary areas of collecting. I have gotten a good amount from change, but do not always remember or make a conscious effort like I do for pennies, and quarters. Just as I mentioned with nickels I would like to find a way to pique my interest.\nQuarters # The second focus of my collection would be quarters. Since 1999 I have collected at least one of every quarter that has been manufactured (50 State Quarters, D.C. and U.S. Territories, and America the Beautiful). It has been fun to collect and see all the different amazing designs the artists come up with to depict the area being represented. Only more recently have I begun to collect quarters prior to 1999. I have been working on the Washington quarters (1932 - 1998). I still look for these in circulation, but the older ones which are hard to find lead me to visit coin shops in the area. Currently my oldest quarter is a 1932, the first year of the Washington quarters.\nFuture # In the future I hope to continue to add to my current collections as well as branch out into older coins. My dad has a coin collection as well, which I hope to continue adding to. He has both buffalo nickels and mercury dimes, of which I hope to continue adding to the collection. As I said earlier, I have a small amount of foreign coins that belonged to my parents. I have always liked the design on foreign coins and paper money and keep them mainly for that reason instead of the value. I would also want to attend a coin show, which I have never done. I may branch out into paper money, but will stick to adding coins first. Coin collecting is fun and something I can continue for the rest of my life.\n","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/coin-collecting/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Coin Collecting","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/coins/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Coins","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/collecting/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Collecting","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hobby/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hobby","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" ","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to my Portfolio \u0026 Blog","summary":"","title":"Welcome to my Portfolio \u0026 Blog","type":"page"},{"content":" About Me # I‚Äôm Chris Frome, a Web and Software Developer based in the Baltimore, MD area.

I got my first introduction to using cast iron from being in the Boy Scouts. The dutch oven makes for easy one dish meals with easy cleanup. You can make everything from breakfast casseroles to soup/stew, pizza or even dessert. Cast iron in general, is great not just for camping but is great when cooking at home too. However, you may not be too familiar with how to properly use use one, so here are the steps (both outdoor and indoor cooking):\nHere is a video on cooking with cast iron from Tasty : Cooking with cast iron\nOutdoor Cooking with Dutch Ovens # Pick a Dutch Oven For outdoor use you want a pre-seasoned tri-leg camp dutch oven with a flanged top. a flanged top will allow you to evenly spread coals on top. The tri-pod legs will keep the dutch oven from sitting directly on the colas underneath. The sizes can range anywhere from 2-qt. - 8-qt. (4 - 12 in.). Here is a great example of an outdoor dutch oven: Lodge outdoor dutch oven Other Materials Needed Long tongs Thick gloves Charcoal briquets (regular, not competition-style) Charcoal chimney starter for lighting the charcoal Prep the fire Light 50 regular briquets in a chimney starter and burn until spotted gray, 15 minutes. Arrange the coals Method A Bottom heat cooking : For recipes where you want concentrated heat from underneath, for saut√©ing or making a quick meat dish, just use tongs to spread the coals into an even layer the size of the dutch oven and set the pot on top. Method B Top and bottom heat cooking: For recipes like long-cooking stews, you need heat coming from top and bottom. Use tongs to arrange some of the coals in a circle a little smaller than the circumference of the dutch oven. Set the oven on top, then arrange the rest of the coals evenly over the lid. Method C Baking: Here you need heat coming from top and bottom, arranged carefully for even browning. Use tongs to arrange some of the coals in a circle a little smaller than the circumference of the dutch oven. Set the oven on top, then arrange a single ring of coals on top of the lid, around the lip. Space a few more across the lid. Check the food To check food and temp, lift the lid occasionally by sliding tongs through the pot lid\u0026rsquo;s ring and bracing them against the edge of the lid closest to you. Tweak the temperature To decrease heat, scrape away some fuel. To increase heat, or to cook longer than 45 minutes, add 5 to 6 new briquets to both the top and the bottom of the dutch oven (touching lit ones, so they‚Äôll ignite) about every 30 minutes, or add wood embers. If briquets don\u0026rsquo;t light, be ready to ignite them in the chimney. However, there are some debates on whether to use soap on cast iron, but many say that a little soap wont hurt the pan. Indoor Cooking with Dutch Ovens # Pick a Dutch Oven Since you will be putting your dutch oven in the oven it is ok for the top to be rounded instead of flanged. Here is a good example of a dutch oven that will work well inside: Le Creuset Signature Round Dutch Oven Can a Dutch Oven go in an Electric Oven? Dutch ovens have been successfully prepared in gas and electric ovens, conventional and convection ovens, buried in campfires coals, inside barbecue grills, in roasters, and even on stovetop burners. The only type of oven I know that you should NOT use with a cast iron Dutch oven is a microwave oven. An oven can work just as well as coals, and the temperature can easier to control. Just make sure your oven can reach 450 degrees fahrenheit. Personal Experience # The majority of my dutch oven cooking experience occurred while on campouts with the Boy Scouts. I have learned to cook everything from breakfast casserole, biscuits, pizza, and dessert cakes and cobblers. Dessert cooking is one of my favorites, and I even learned a hack when making a cake. Instead of adding everything listed on the box to the cake mix, all you need is a bottle of sprite or other soda. This will work as a replacement for the ingredients like eggs and water and allow you to have a moist and delicious cake.\nCleaning Cast Iron # Is soap good for cast iron?
